# Attendance Management System

## Intro
Taking attendance of around 120 students in a class is a very tedious task the professors have to complete. <br/>
It is now simplified by using this Attendance App made using Flutter as the main technology and Firebase as the backend.

## Features
The app is easy to use for students as well as teachers.<br/>
Simply Signup using the college id credentials and then sac the QR Code generated in the teacher's app to mark the attendance.<br/>
The app also checks for the location of the student as well teachers and also the time of marking of attendance by the student and the time during which the teacher took the attendance to prevent false attendance.<br/>
The app automatcially assigns absent status to students who do not match the location and timing criteria.<br/>
Teachers can also see the attednance status date-wise and subject-wise attendance status of studenst after completing the attendance.
